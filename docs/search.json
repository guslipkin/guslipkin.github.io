    "text": "Link to the Medium post\n\nIntro\nIt’s a tale as old as time. Your boss gave you a bunch of Excel files and you painstakingly made a bot that will import and display them in a Shiny dashboard. Proud of your work, you take it to your boss and they say “I don’t know what a ‘Shiny’ is, can’t you just give me one of those Excels back?” openxlsx makes this easy.\nToday we’re going to recreate an existing workbook with openxlsx. To get started, I made a small .xlsx file for us to work with that can be downloaded here. It’s an attendance list and some notes on supplies you’ll need for a company barbecue. Feel free to get familiar with it then come back here when you’re ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The attendance sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The supplies sheet\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A preview of the Attendance and Supplies sheets\n\n\n\n\n\nReading an Existing Workbook\nAs usual, the first thing to do is load our library with library(openxlsx). We can try and load the workbook, the Excel file, with read.xlsx, but for now we’re going to use loadWorkbook. This loads a workbook object and exposes some workbook properties to us rather than just the raw data like with read.xlsx.\n\n# load openxlsx\nlibrary(openxlsx)\n# get the sheet names\nbbq &lt;- loadWorkbook(filePath)\nnames(bbq)\n\n# load the sheets and preview them\nattendance &lt;- readWorkbook(bbq, \"Attendance\")\nhead(attendance)\n\nsupplies &lt;- readWorkbook(bbq, sheet = \"Supplies\")\nhead(supplies)\n\n[1] “Attendance” “Supplies”\n\n\n\n\nName\nRSVPed\nStatus\nFoodPreference\n\n\n\n\n1\nMasud Durga\nTRUE\nNo\nNA\n\n\n2\nStanislav Zillah\nTRUE\nYes\nHotdog\n\n\n3\nJoaquina Aristide\nFALSE\nNA\nNA\n\n\n4\nIuppiter Dieu\nTRUE\nYes\nHotdog\n\n\n5\nHari Evgenios\nTRUE\nYes\nHamburger\n\n\n6\nShaina Gwenaelle\nTRUE\nYes\nHotdog\n\n\n\n\nThe attendance data.frame\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplyType\nQuantity\nPerPackage\nPackagesNeeded\nLeftover\n\n\n\n\n1\nHotdogs\n34\n10\n4\n6\n\n\n2\nHotdog buns\nNA\n8\n5\n6\n\n\n3\nHamburgers\n36\n6\n6\n0\n\n\n4\nHamburger buns\nNA\n8\n5\n4\n\n\n\n\nThe supplies data.frame\n\nBecause we loaded the data as a workbook object, we can use getStyles to load the styles and preview them. Unfortunately, the styles can’t pull conditional formatting and don’t keep track of which cells use which styles. By cross referencing the list of styles and bbq.xlsx, we can identify some styles to use and them assign them each to a variable.\n\n# getStyles and set them appropriately\nstyles &lt;- getStyles(bbq)\nstyles\n\n# doesn't work for colors because those are conditional formatting\nheaderStyle &lt;- styles[[1]]\nnumberStyle &lt;- styles[[7]]\n\nI’ve chosen to only show the first two items from the styles list here.\n[[1]]\nA custom cell style. \n\n Cell formatting: GENERAL \n Font name: Calibri \n Font size: 14 \n Font colour: 1 \n Font decoration: BOLD \n \n\n[[2]]\nA custom cell style. \n\n Cell formatting: GENERAL \n Cell horz. align: center\n\n\n\nCreating a Workbook\nFirst thing we have to do is create a workbook object that we’ll call wb. We can quickly preview it by just typing wb into our chunk or the console.\n\n# create workbook and check contents\nwb &lt;- createWorkbook()\nwb\n\nA Workbook object.\n \nWorksheets:\n No worksheets attached\n\n\nWe’re going to make the Supplies sheet first as it’s a little bit easier. We first add a new worksheet named Supplies to the workbook, then we can write the relevant data to that sheet along with styling our column headers using headerStyle from earlier.\n\n# create the supplies sheet and check for it\naddWorksheet(wb = wb, sheetName = \"Supplies\")\n# write supplies to the worksheet using headerStyle\nwriteData(wb = wb, sheet = \"Supplies\", x = supplies, headerStyle = headerStyle)\n\n\n\nAdding Styles\nAll of the numbers in the Supplies sheet are centered both horizontally and vertically. We can achieve this by adding the numberStyle from before to those cells. rows and cols both start at 2 because row one is the header row and column one is the supply type. rows goes to 5 because there are 4 rows of numbers (remember the header row) and cols goes to 5 because there are 4 columns of numbers. gridExpand = TRUE makes sure that all cell reference combinations possible with rows and cols are used, rather than doing an entire row or column.\n\n# add numberStyle\naddStyle(wb = wb, sheet = \"Supplies\", style = numberStyle, rows = 2:5, \n         cols = 2:5, gridExpand = TRUE)\n\nIf we go back to our data in R, the Quantity for Hotdog buns and Hamburger buns is empty. A bit further back, we see that that’s because those cells were merged with the Quantity of Hotdogs and Hamburgers respectively. We can replicate this using mergeCells. Unlike addStyle, we don’t need to use gridExpand to merge all the cells as it is implied. cols will be 2 for both and we want rows 2 and 3 for Hotdogs and rows 4 and 5 for Hamburgers.\n\n# merge the hamburger and hotdog quantity cells\nmergeCells(wb = wb, sheet = \"Supplies\", cols = 2, rows = 2:3)\nmergeCells(wb = wb, sheet = \"Supplies\", cols = 2, rows = 4:5)\n\nOur last step on this worksheet is to set the column widths to auto. We again need to specify cols and can just do 1:5 so that all columns are affected.\n\n# set column widths to auto\nsetColWidths(wb = wb, sheet = \"Supplies\", cols = 1:5, widths = \"auto\")\n\nOu Supplies sheet is now complete, but we’re not going to write it just yet because we still need to do the Attendance sheet.\nLike before, we first add the Attendance worksheet and write the data to it.\n\n# create the attendance sheet and check for it\naddWorksheet(wb = wb, sheetName = \"Attendance\")\n\n# write attendance to the worksheet using the same headerStyle from before\nwriteData(wb = wb, sheet = \"Attendance\", x = attendance, \n          headerStyle = headerStyle)\n\n\n\n\nConditional Formatting\nThe RSVPed and Status columns each have some conditional formatting. We can reuse the color formatting from the RSVPed column on the Status column, so we’re going to separate the color style from the alignment style. It was easy to see how many rows we have in the Supplies sheet but not here so we’re going to create a new variable that has the rowNumbers. Again, we start on row 2 because of the header row and will end at our last data row plus 1.\n\n# create color styles for rsvp and status\ngoodStyle &lt;- createStyle(fontColour = \"#006100\", bgFill = \"#C6EFCE\")\nbadStyle &lt;- createStyle(fontColour = \"#9C0006\", bgFill = \"#FFC7CE\")\n# create center style for rsvp column\ncenterStyle &lt;- createStyle(halign = \"center\")\n\n# create a variable of row numbers\nrowNumbers &lt;- seq(2, nrow(attendance) + 1, by = 1)\n\nOur first step is to center the values in the RSVPed column with an addStyle. Next, while we could manually color each cell using a for loop, it’s more efficient to use conditionalFormatting. This also has the added bonus of showing in Excel and responding to any changes. The rule argument may be a little strange, and that’s because it must match how the same formatting rule would be written in Excel. In this case, we use our top-leftmost cell as the reference cell in the rule, B2, then we check if it is TRUE or FALSE. When the rule is applied down the cells in column B, the row number will change to match the current row.\n\n# center the column values\naddStyle(wb = wb, sheet = \"Attendance\", \n         style = centerStyle, cols = 2, rows = rowNumbers)\n\n# IF `RSVPed` is TRUE, set it to green. IF FALSE, set it to red\nconditionalFormatting(wb = wb, sheet = \"Attendance\", cols = 2, \n                      rows = rowNumbers, rule = \"B2==TRUE\", style = goodStyle)\nconditionalFormatting(wb = wb, sheet = \"Attendance\", cols = 2, \n                      rows = rowNumbers, rule = \"B2==FALSE\", style = badStyle)\n\nThe Status column is very similar to the RSVPed column, but we add a style for Tentative responses and then need a third conditionalFormatting. The newest part here is in the rule argument. We need to put quotes around Yes so that Excel knows that it is a string and need to use \\\" so that R knows that the quote is part of the string. Once our formatting has been applied, we set the column widths as we did before.\n\n# add style for status and tentative\nmaybeStyle &lt;- createStyle(fontColour = \"#9C6500\", bgFill = \"#FFEB9C\")\n\nconditionalFormatting(wb = wb, sheet = \"Attendance\", cols = 3, \n                      rows = rowNumbers, rule = \"C2==\\\"Yes\\\"\", \n                      style = goodStyle)\nconditionalFormatting(wb = wb, sheet = \"Attendance\", cols = 3, \n                      rows = rowNumbers, rule = \"C2==\\\"No\\\"\", \n                      style = badStyle)\nconditionalFormatting(wb = wb, sheet = \"Attendance\", cols = 3, \n                      rows = rowNumbers, rule = \"C2==\\\"Tentative\\\"\", \n                      style = maybeStyle)\n\n# set column widths to auto\nsetColWidths(wb = wb, sheet = \"Attendance\", cols = 1:4, widths = \"auto\")\n\n\n\n\nWriting the Workbook\nThe last thing we need to do is reorder the worksheets so that Attendance is first because when we created the workbook in R, we created the Supplies worksheet first. Unfortunately, worksheetOrder only supports integer vectors. We can check our worksheet numbers by calling the object again through either the chunk or console. Then we set the worksheet order and save the workbook to an .xlsx file.\n\n# check the workbook sheet order\nwb\n\nA Workbook object.\n \nWorksheets:\n Sheet 1: \"Supplies\"\n \n    Custom column widths (column: width)\n      1: auto, 2: auto, 3: auto, 4: auto, 5: auto \n \n\n Sheet 2: \"Attendance\"\n \n    Custom column widths (column: width)\n      1: auto, 2: auto, 3: auto, 4: auto \n \n\n \n Worksheet write order: 1, 2\n Active Sheet 1: \"Supplies\" \n    Position: 1\n\n# change the order\nworksheetOrder(wb) &lt;- c(2, 1)\n\n# save the workbook\nsaveWorkbook(wb, outputPath, overwrite = TRUE)\n\nIf we open the new file, we can see that they are nearly identical. The biggest difference between the two is that the original used formulas to calculate the values in Supplies.\nIf you did want to take it a step further and use those instead, the writeFormula function is your friend. In any case, I highly encourage everyone to at least skim through the openxlsx documentation here because it has so much to offer to help streamline Excel file generation.\n\nAll the code for this article is available here.

    "text": "for loop\nIf you’re familiar with programming, you can probably skip this section.\nA for loop lets you run the same code a specified number of times. The structure generally follows for(x in y) where x represents an item in y. If we think about a shopping basket with some apples, bananas, and carrots, we could write for(food in basket) and food would represent each item in our basket. It would be apples the first time, bananas the second time, and carrots the third time. We could also write it as for(food in 1:length(basket)) where 1:length(basket) is a vector of numbers that counts the items in your basket. Rather than food representing an item in your basket, it represents an index in the vector. In this example, apples are at index 1, bananas at 2, and carrots at 3. for loops are also very flexible and can be used on many data types such as vectors, data.frames, and matrices.\nLet’s say you have a data.frame called basket that has three columns. It has the Food column with the name of the food, the PricePerUnit which has the unit cost for each food, and Quantity which has the number of units of each food in your basket. It looks like this:\n\n\n\nFood\nPricePerUnit\nQuantity\n\n\n\n\nApples\n0.99\n12\n\n\nBananas\n0.19\n6\n\n\nCarrots\n0.49\n2\n\n\n\nAnd it can be recreated with this:\n\nbasket &lt;- data.frame(\"Food\" = c(\"Apples\", \"Bananas\", \"Carrots\"),\n                     \"PricePerUnit\" = c(.99, .19, .49),\n                     \"Quantity\" = c(12, 6, 2))\n\nIf we wanted to get the total cost of everything in our basket, we could iterate over each row multiplying the PricePerUnit and Quantity and adding those to our running totals.\n\n# create the total\ntotal &lt;- 0\n# loop over the data.frame and add the running total\nfor(row in 1:nrow(basket))\n  total &lt;- total + (basket$PricePerUnit[row] * basket$Quantity[row])\ntotal\n\n[1] 14"

    "section": "apply family",
    "text": "apply family\nThe apply family is part of base R and very similar to a for loop. Rather than running a set number of times, an apply runs a function on each item in a data.frame, list, vector, or other object that can be applied to. While there are six different functions in the apply family, I’m only going to talk about the three most common; apply, lapply, and sapply.\nThe biggest differences between the three is the types of input that they accept and their output types. apply takes in a data.frame or matrix and has three function arguments. The first argument, x, is the object we’re passing to it. The second argument is a number, either 1 or 2 or c(1, 2), that says if we want the function applied to rows, columns, or both rows and columns, respectively. The last argument is the function call. sapply and lapply are the same, except they don’t have the second argument because they take either a vector or list which don’t have multiple dimensions. Generally speaking, the apply family will return a vector, list, or array of some kind.\nIf we go back to the shopping basket example, we can calculate the total with an apply function. Our first argument is the basket, the second is a 1 because we want to apply to every row, and the last is the function call. We can create the function in the apply call or we can create it earlier and then call it here.\n\n# multiply each PricePerUnit and Quantity and store the resulting vector\nperItemTotal &lt;- apply(basket, 1, function(bskt) {\n  as.numeric(bskt[\"PricePerUnit\"]) * as.numeric(bskt[\"Quantity\"])\n})\n# sum all values in the perItemTotal\nsum(perItemTotal)\n\n[1] 14\n\n\nA quick note on function calls in the apply family:\nIf a function call only has one argument, they can be done in three ways. 1. sapply(X, function(x) { ... }) if function is not predefined 2. sapply(X, function) if function is predefined 3. sapply(X, function(x)) if function is predefined\nOption two is most common for built-in functions such as sum or as.numeric, but can be used with any function."

The second big difference is that column names in pivot_wider don’t have to be in quotes. They can be, but they don’t have to be.

    "text": "Wider with One Value Column\nIn this example, we want to know how long the actualWait is for each ride throughout the day with each recording time as a row, and each ride as a column.\nIn the pivot_wider, we want our new column names_from to be the shortName and our values_from actualWait. The tricky bit here is the id_cols argument. id_cols are columns whose values should uniquely identify each row in the data. We need to use it because the rideName and shortName columns are perfectly correlated, that is, for each row the value of both columns will always be the same. Any column that is not in the names_from or values_from argument will be part of the default id_cols argument. We can use the argument two ways; we can use a numeric vector to select the columns that we want to be used as identifiers, or we can specify columns that we do not want used as a character or column name vector. In the example below, I’ve included both methods. For the rest of the post, I’ll be using the second method.\nAs mentioned previously, the biggest difference for dcast is that it uses a formula instead of the id_cols and names_from arguments. The left hand side of the formula is the columns that you want to stay as columns to be used as the unique identifier for each row. The right hand side of the formula is the column whose values will be used as the new column names.

    "text": "Intro\nLike grammar in English, the grammar of graphics (ggplot2) can be somewhat confusing at times. Usually you know what you want your chart to look like but you’re not sure exactly how to get there. A common issue is trying to get your discrete axis to show up in the order you want, whether it’s getting your days of the week in order or ordering columns in ascending or descending order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) In order by day of the week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) In ascending order grouped by month\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bar charts organized by day of the week and descending order, respectively\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Data\nAs usual, we want to load the tidyverse first since it gives us %&gt;% from magrittr and ggplot2 and everything that comes with it.\nThe dummy data for this post is painting sales. You’re a starving artist who hasn’t taken any days off selling paintings in the past year and you’re trying to start taking a day to yourself every week. Our data has the day of the month (only 28 days per month), the month, the day of the week, and the number of paintings you sold each day. R has a constant built in for the name of the month, month.name, but not one for the days of the week, so we’ll have to make that ourselves. In addition, we start our week on a Sunday.\n\nset.seed(2022)\ndays_of_the_week &lt;- c(\"Sunday\", \"Monday\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", \n                      \"Thursday\", \"Friday\", \"Saturday\")\nsales &lt;- data.frame(\"dayOfMonth\" = rep(1:28, 12),\n                    \"month\" = rep(month.name, each = 28),\n                    \"weekday\" = rep(days_of_the_week, 12*4),\n                    \"paintings\" = round(rnorm(28*12, c(sample(1:28, 7)))))\n\nhead(sales, 7)\n\n  dayOfMonth   month   weekday paintings\n1          1 January    Sunday         2\n2          2 January    Monday        20\n3          3 January   Tuesday        13\n4          4 January Wednesday        23\n5          5 January  Thursday        10\n6          6 January    Friday        28\n7          7 January  Saturday         7\n\n\nThe first week’s data shows that we sold the bulk of our paintings on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with barely any sales on Sunday and Saturday.\n\n\nGetting the Days in Order\nIn the first chart we make, we want to take the average number of sales per day of the week. To do that, we group_by(weekday) and then summarise the mean(paintings) as a new variable, weekdaySales. In the ggplot chain, we set the chart and axis titles with labs and the color palette with scale_fill_brewer. In aes in geom_bar, we want the weekday on the x axis and weekdaySales on the y axis. To add some color, we set fill = weekday. Outside of the aes but still in geom_bar, we set stat = \"identity\" so that the y axis value is used and show.legend = FALSE to hide the legend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI’ve organized the ggplot() chain so that the items being changed are towards the bottom. The ggplot(), labs(), and scale_fill_brewer() are the same in every example.\nThe only aspects of geom_bar() that will change are the values used for x and y in aes().\n\n\n\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Painting Sales by Day of the Week\",\n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Mean Painting Sales\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = weekday, y = weekdaySales, fill = weekday), \n           stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, our days of the week are not in order. Lots of people would be very sad if Monday came directly after Friday.\n\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Weekly Painting Sales by Day of the Week\",\n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Mean Painting Sales\") + \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = factor(weekday, days_of_the_week), y = weekdaySales, \n               fill = weekday), stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nBy changing x = weekday to x = factor(weekday, days_of_the_week), we can get the days in order. The key here is that factor() takes two arguments; a vector of data and a vector defining the levels of the data in order. In this case, days_of_the_week defines the levels in order.\n\n\nAscending or Descending Order\nWhile the graph we just got does the job, we want to see how big the jumps are in order between days of the week. Similarly to getting our days of the week in order, we need to change x = weekday to something else to get our x axis sorted in ascending or descending order. While factor() lets us reorder them by factor levels, reorder allows us to reorder by numeric value. The first argument is the vector we want to change, in this case, weekday, and we want to change it to match the order of the second argument, weekdaySales. In fact, reorder(weekday, weekdaySales) is the same as sales$weekday[order(sales$weekdaySales)].\n\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Weekly Painting Sales in Ascending Order\",\n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Mean Painting Sales\") + \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(weekday, weekdaySales), y = weekdaySales, \n               fill = weekday), stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nThe default order is ascending order, smallest to largest. To reverse the order, we can add a minus sign before the second argument so that it reads reorder(weekday, -weekdaySales).\n\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Mean Weekly Painting Sales in Descending Order\",\n       x = \"Day of the Week\",\n       y = \"Mean Painting Sales\") + \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(weekday, -weekdaySales), y = weekdaySales, \n               fill = weekday), stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempting to Order Within Facets\nBefore we get started on facets, I want to change the data a little so that the examples are a little clearer. By adding some variation into the paintings variable, the differences between days of different months will be more apparent.\n\nsales$paintings &lt;- round(rnorm(28*12, c(sample(1:28, 28*12, replace = TRUE))))\n\nThinking that maybe we’d like to switch up our day off every month, we want to see how our sales change over the course of the year, but still group_by(weekday). However, since we want to know the mean for each weekday for each month, we need to add that so we have group_by(month, weekday). We also add facet_wrap(~ month) to the end of the ggplot chain. Essentially, this means that we want to have a mini plot for each month. In this case, we’ve ordered our y axis so that the days of the week are in order from top to bottom.\n\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(month, weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Daily Painting Sales by Month\",\n       x = \"Mean Painting Sales\",\n       y = \"Day of the Week\") + \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = weekdaySales, y = factor(weekday, rev(days_of_the_week)), \n               fill = weekday), stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ month)\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all well and good, but what if we want each month ordered in descending order like we had the chart before? We can try changing y = factor() to y = reorder(). We also add scales = \"free_y\" to facet_wrap so that each chart’s y axis is calculated independently. It’s quickly apparent that this doesn’t work the way we were expecting it to. The facets are not sorted properly and all of them are sorted the same way.\n\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(month, weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Daily Painting Sales by Month but not in Descending Order\",\n       x = \"Mean Painting Sales\",\n       y = \"Day of the Week\") + \n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = weekdaySales, y = reorder(weekday, weekdaySales), \n               fill = weekday), stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ month, scales = \"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\nNot sure what happened, we try to investigate. If we re-run the earlier Mean Weekly Painting Sales in Descending Order chart with the new data and grouped by weekday, we find that the y axis in each facet is, in fact, in order with Sunday with the highest sales and Friday with the lowest, but the order hasn’t been recalculated for each month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdering Within Facets\nAs it turns out, there’s a rather simple way to give your facets each their own ordering. The tidytext package provides the functionality with three functions that go hand-in-hand. reorder_within() does the heavy lifting while scale_x_reordered() and scale_y_reordered() make sure that the order set in reorder_within() is respected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nJulia Silge writes about reorder_within on her blog here and has some information on its creation and how it came to live in tidytext in the first paragraph of the “Enter reorder_within()” section.\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\nInstead of using factor() and reorder(), we change the y axis argument in aes() to use reorder_within: y = reorder_within(weekday, weekdaySales, month). Our first argument, weekday is the vector we want to reorder. The second argument, weekdaySales is the variable we want to use for reordering. The last argument, month, is the variable we want to use for grouping. The third argument could be a vector of column names if we wanted to group by multiple variables. Like with reorder(), we can set the direction to ascending with a minus sign before the ordering argument, weekdaySales. We keep scales = \"free_y\" in facet_wrap() so that each facet has its own order, and then use scale_y_reordered() to make sure that the new order from reorder_within() is used.\n\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(month, weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Daily Painting Sales in Descending Order by Month\",\n       x = \"Mean Painting Sales\",\n       y = \"Day of the Week\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = weekdaySales, \n               y = reorder_within(weekday, weekdaySales, month), \n               fill = weekday), stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ month, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_y_reordered()\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(month, weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Daily Painting Sales in Ascending Order by Month\",\n       x = \"Mean Painting Sales\",\n       y = \"Day of the Week\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = weekdaySales, \n               y = reorder_within(weekday, -weekdaySales, month), \n               fill = weekday), stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ month, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_y_reordered()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdering Facets and an Easier Way to Order by Day\nAt this point, you might be staring at your screen in disbelief and thinking, “But Gus, the facets aren’t in order! The months are in alphabetical order and not calendar order!” You’re not wrong. When we were setting the order of y with factor(), we were doing something that we could have done much earlier in our data creation stage. If we redefine the month and weekday variables using the factor(variable, levels) syntax, we don’t need to use y = factor(weekday) to make sure our days are in order. In addition, the facets will now be in calendar order like they appear in the month.name constant. I’ve chosen to reverse the days_of_the_week so that Sunday appears at the top, rather than at the bottom of the y axis.\n\nsales$month &lt;- factor(sales$month, levels = month.name)\nsales$weekday &lt;- factor(sales$weekday, levels = rev(days_of_the_week))\n\nsales %&gt;%\n  group_by(month, weekday) %&gt;%\n  summarise(weekdaySales = mean(paintings)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Daily Painting Sales in Descending Order by Month\",\n       x = \"Mean Painting Sales\",\n       y = \"Day of the Week\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = weekdaySales, y = weekday, fill = weekday), \n           stat = \"identity\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~ month)\n\n\n\n\n\nAll code used in this article is available here.

When we hear people ask about moving data and processes to the cloud, it’s hard not to think of the Little Green Men from Toy Story worshiping “The Claw”. Within a few short breaths, you’ve been asked to try and move all your current processes to the cloud. It’s a daunting task, but with a few handy tricks, we can make the SQL conversion relatively painless.\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI’ve generally tried to keep the R and Python code as similar as possible, but that’s not always the wisest move. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out.\n\n\nOur first step is to load our packages and connect to spark. We’ll also create a local spark instance to use rather than link to a server.

Where I work, all of our tables are in delta or parquet formats.

You pull the schema for the athlete_bio_vw table and get the following SQL that references athlete_bio.\n\nSELECT \n  athlete_id, name, sex, CAST(born AS DATE), \n  CAST(height AS DOUBLE), CAST(weight AS DOUBLE), \n  country, country_noc\nFROM athlete_bio \nWHERE \n  height != \"na\" AND\n  weight != \"na\"\n\nWe can re-create the views three ways. We can use R or Python to recreate the view from scratch by referencing the table variable name, not the internal Spark name. We can also wrap a SQL statement in our language of choice and use the internal Spark name. We then assign this new data frame to tbl_athlete_bio_vw. However, because the new data frame has been assigned as a variable, we no longer have direct and easy access to the view inside further SQL queries, and would have to use R or Python to do any more analysis.\n\nRPython\n\n\n\n# R\ntbl_athlete_bio_vw &lt;-\n  tbl_athlete_bio |&gt; \n    filter(height != \"na\", weight != \"na\") |&gt;\n    mutate(born = as.Date(born), \n           height = as.double(height), \n           weight = as.double(weight)) |&gt;\n    select(athlete_id, name, sex, born, height, weight, country, country_noc)\n# SQL\ntbl_athlete_bio_vw &lt;- sdf_sql(sc, '\n  SELECT \n    athlete_id, name, sex, CAST(born AS DATE), CAST(height AS DOUBLE), \n    CAST(weight AS DOUBLE), country, country_noc\n  FROM athlete_bio \n  WHERE \n    height != \"na\" AND\n    weight != \"na\"')\n\nhead(tbl_athlete_bio_vw)\n\n# Source: spark&lt;?&gt; [?? x 8]\n  athlete_id name                sex    born       height weight country count…¹\n       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  \n1      43737 Andrzej Socharski   Male   1947-08-31    173     72 \" Pola… POL    \n2      50147 Nathalie Wunderlich Female 1971-06-03    170     50 \" Swit… SUI    \n3       5085 Miha Lokar          Male   1935-09-10    182     76 \" Yugo… YUG    \n4     136329 Austin Hack         Male   1992-05-17    203    100 \" Unit… USA    \n5      38633 Tsuneo Ogasawara    Male   1942-07-30    181     80 \" Japa… JPN    \n6      77095 Fulgence Rwabu      Male   1947-11-23    165     51 \" Ugan… UGA    \n# … with abbreviated variable name ¹​country_noc\n\n\n\n\n\n# Python\ntbl_athlete_bio_vw = tbl_athlete_bio.filter('height != \"na\" AND weight != \"na\"'\n    ).select(['athlete_id', 'name', 'sex', col('born').cast('date'), \n              col('height').cast('double'), col('weight').cast('double'), \n              'country', 'country_noc'])\n# SQL\ntbl_athlete_bio_vw = sc.sql('''\n  SELECT \n    athlete_id, name, sex, CAST(born AS DATE), CAST(height AS DOUBLE), \n    CAST(weight AS DOUBLE), country, country_noc\n  FROM athlete_bio \n  WHERE \n    height != \"na\" AND\n    weight != \"na\"''')\n    \ntbl_athlete_bio_vw.show(6)\n\n+----------+-------------------+------+----------+------+------+--------------+-----------+\n|athlete_id|               name|   sex|      born|height|weight|       country|country_noc|\n+----------+-------------------+------+----------+------+------+--------------+-----------+\n|     43737|  Andrzej Socharski|  Male|1947-08-31| 173.0|  72.0|        Poland|        POL|\n|     50147|Nathalie Wunderlich|Female|1971-06-03| 170.0|  50.0|   Switzerland|        SUI|\n|      5085|         Miha Lokar|  Male|1935-09-10| 182.0|  76.0|    Yugoslavia|        YUG|\n|    136329|        Austin Hack|  Male|1992-05-17| 203.0| 100.0| United States|        USA|\n|     38633|   Tsuneo Ogasawara|  Male|1942-07-30| 181.0|  80.0|         Japan|        JPN|\n|     77095|     Fulgence Rwabu|  Male|1947-11-23| 165.0|  51.0|        Uganda|        UGA|\n+----------+-------------------+------+----------+------+------+--------------+-----------+\nonly showing top 6 rows\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third way is a little chaotic, but is actually my preferred method because I can save the queries I want to use as subqueries later on. First we save the query as a string and then use the R {glue} package or f-strings from Python to run the SQL query in the tbl_athlete_bio_qry variable. Because this method lends itself to subqueries so well, I don’t usually use it unless I intend to use the query later on.\nIf you’re not familiar, both glue and f-strings take a regular string and insert the value of the variable inside curly braces {}. For example, if you have a variable named name that has someone’s name. You can use glue or f-strings to write \"hello {name}\" and when this is evaluated, if the name is Gus, it will print “hello Gus.”\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nathlete_bio_vw_qry &lt;- '\n  SELECT \n    athlete_id, name, sex, CAST(born AS DATE), CAST(height AS DOUBLE), \n    CAST(weight AS DOUBLE), country, country_noc\n  FROM athlete_bio \n  WHERE \n    height != \"na\" AND\n    weight != \"na\"'\ntbl_athlete_bio_vw &lt;- sdf_sql(sc, glue(\"{athlete_bio_vw_qry}\"))\n\nhead(tbl_athlete_bio_vw)\n\n# Source: spark&lt;?&gt; [?? x 8]\n  athlete_id name                sex    born       height weight country count…¹\n       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  \n1      43737 Andrzej Socharski   Male   1947-08-31    173     72 \" Pola… POL    \n2      50147 Nathalie Wunderlich Female 1971-06-03    170     50 \" Swit… SUI    \n3       5085 Miha Lokar          Male   1935-09-10    182     76 \" Yugo… YUG    \n4     136329 Austin Hack         Male   1992-05-17    203    100 \" Unit… USA    \n5      38633 Tsuneo Ogasawara    Male   1942-07-30    181     80 \" Japa… JPN    \n6      77095 Fulgence Rwabu      Male   1947-11-23    165     51 \" Ugan… UGA    \n# … with abbreviated variable name ¹​country_noc\n\n\n\n\n\nathlete_bio_vw_qry = '''\n  SELECT \n    athlete_id, name, sex, CAST(born AS DATE), CAST(height AS DOUBLE), \n    CAST(weight AS DOUBLE), country, country_noc\n  FROM athlete_bio \n  WHERE \n    height != \"na\" AND\n    weight != \"na\"'''\ntbl_athlete_bio_vw = sc.sql(f'''{athlete_bio_vw_qry}''')\n\ntbl_athlete_bio_vw.show(6)\n\n+----------+-------------------+------+----------+------+------+--------------+-----------+\n|athlete_id|               name|   sex|      born|height|weight|       country|country_noc|\n+----------+-------------------+------+----------+------+------+--------------+-----------+\n|     43737|  Andrzej Socharski|  Male|1947-08-31| 173.0|  72.0|        Poland|        POL|\n|     50147|Nathalie Wunderlich|Female|1971-06-03| 170.0|  50.0|   Switzerland|        SUI|\n|      5085|         Miha Lokar|  Male|1935-09-10| 182.0|  76.0|    Yugoslavia|        YUG|\n|    136329|        Austin Hack|  Male|1992-05-17| 203.0| 100.0| United States|        USA|\n|     38633|   Tsuneo Ogasawara|  Male|1942-07-30| 181.0|  80.0|         Japan|        JPN|\n|     77095|     Fulgence Rwabu|  Male|1947-11-23| 165.0|  51.0|        Uganda|        UGA|\n+----------+-------------------+------+----------+------+------+--------------+-----------+\nonly showing top 6 rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubqueries\nYou probably know that the idea behind subqueries is that it lets you nest operations. The idea behind my third method (I really need a better name for it) is the same. Rather, instead of nesting queries directly, we’re nesting strings which are then evaluated as queries. In this example, we’re going to make another subquery called tbl_athlete_results_qry that contains all columns from the athlete_results Spark table for medal winners.

A relatively common task could be to change dates on a monthly query to filter for the last thirty days. However, I don’t think any Olympians have been born in the last thirty days, probably because the last Olympics was more than thirty days ago. Nevertheless, we can filter for athletes that were born in the last thirty years. In R, the {lubridate} makes the year subtraction a breeze while python-dateutil does all the heavy lifting in Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nthirtyYears &lt;- ymd(Sys.Date()) - years(30)\n\nsdf_sql(sc, glue('\n  SELECT *\n  FROM athlete_bio_vw\n  WHERE born &gt;= \"{thirtyYears}\"\n  LIMIT 6'))\n\n# Source: spark&lt;?&gt; [?? x 8]\n  athlete_id name               sex    born       height weight country  count…¹\n       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;  \n1     136346 Pedro Pascual      Male   1996-03-15    185     70 \" Unite… USA    \n2     131521 Ana Dascăl         Female 2002-09-12    183     60 \" Roman… ROU    \n3     137091 Saskia Alusalu     Female 1994-04-14    175     64 \" Eston… EST    \n4     134220 Jason Osborne      Male   1994-03-20    178     72 \" Germa… GER    \n5     143729 C.

It probably still will be painful, but I’m hoping that it’ll now be at most regular painful. We learned that we can either translate our queries to R or Python, run a SQL directly, or save the query as a string, and insert it into later queries where it will be run directly. We can then take our new tables and transfer them back over to Spark so we can reference the tables directly without any shenanigans involving glue or f-strings. Lastly, we can use those same glue and f-string tricks to dynamically change our queries based on R or Python variables.\n\n\nResources\nBoth R and Python have some really great resources out there to help you get started. I highly recommend starting with the documentation for sparklyr and PySpark as each have everything you need to know (besides the info in my post!) to get started.\n\nR: spark.rstudio.com\nPython: PySpark\n\n\nAll code in this article is available here.

    "text": "Link to the Medium post\n\nIntro\nSometimes you have a chart that looks like one of these. You have a grouped chart that shows one thing and a stacked chart that shows another. But you really want to show the continent of origin and the condition in one chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A grouped bar chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) A stacked bar chart\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A grouped bar chart and a stacked bar chart\n\n\nMaybe the chart you want looks a lot like this:\n\n\n\nA grouped and stacked bar chart\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Data\nFirst we load ggplot2 so we can make our charts. Then we make some data and preview it. set.seed(2022) makes sure that our data is the same every time.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nset.seed(2022)\nspecie &lt;- c(rep(\"sorgho\", 6), rep(\"poacee\", 6), \n            rep(\"banana\", 6), rep(\"triticum\", 6))\ncondition &lt;- rep(c(\"normal\" , \"stress\" , \"N2\") , 8)\ncontinent &lt;- rep(c(\"Europe\", \"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"South America\",          \n                   \"North America\", \"Australia\"), 4)\nvalue &lt;- abs(rnorm(24 , 0 , 15))\ndata &lt;- data.frame(specie, condition, continent, value)\nhead(data)\n\n\nCreating the data\n\n\n\n\n\nspecie\ncondition\ncontinent\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n1\nsorgho\nnormal\nEurope\n33.2982559377826\n\n\n2\nsorgho\nstress\nAfrica\n7.4199245988712\n\n\n3\nsorgho\nN2\nAsia\n52.3689859681817\n\n\n4\nsorgho\nnormal\nSouth America\n4.85975695583929\n\n\n5\nsorgho\nstress\nNorth America\n6.84424418650998\n\n\n6\nsorgho\nN2\nAustralia\n6.74199859289553\n\n\n\n\nPreviewing the data\n\n\n\n\nNot Quite Right\nOur first instinct might be to throw both charts together using grid.arrange from the gridextra package. While this does show the information we want, it’s not pretty and doesn’t show the data the way we want it to.\n\none &lt;- ggplot(data) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = specie, y = value, fill = condition), \n           position = \"dodge\", stat = \"identity\")\ntwo &lt;- ggplot(data) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = specie, y = value, fill = continent), \n           position = \"stack\", stat = \"identity\")\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(one, two, nrow = 2)\n\n\n\n\nNot sure what to do, we come up with lots of plots that are almost right, but not quite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Three attempts at making a grouped and stacked bar chart\n\n\nThe last one looks like it could be promising. How did we do it?\n\nggplot(data) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = condition, y = value, fill = continent),\n           position = \"stack\",\n           stat = \"identity\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ specie)\n\nWe use ggplot to set up the pipeline, geom_bar to create the bar chart, and then facet_wrap is what gives us the four separate charts in one, with one mini-chart for each species. If we can move the charts to be side-by-side, we’ll be a lot closer to the desired outcome. We can use facet_grid instead of facet_wrap to accomplish that.\n\nggplot(data) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = condition, y = value, fill = continent),\n           position = \"stack\",\n           stat = \"identity\") +\n  facet_grid(~ specie)\n\n\n\n\nUsing facet_grid() to show multiple plots next to each other\n\n\n\n\nThis looks much better, but we want it to look like one cohesive plot, rather than four smaller plots.\n\n\n\nThe Final Product\nI’m going to show you the code that does it, then walk through it so everything makes sense.\n\nggplot(data) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = condition, y = value, fill = continent),\n           position = \"stack\",\n           stat = \"identity\") +\n  facet_grid(~ specie, switch = \"x\") +\n  theme(strip.placement = \"outside\",\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = \"white\"),\n        panel.spacing = unit(-.01,\"cm\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe graph that we came here for\n\n\n\n\nThis looks pretty good and is exactly what we wanted. Like the charts before, we get 90% of the way there with ggplot, geom_bar, and facet_grid. The additions here are the switch = \"x\" argument in facet_grid, which moves the group panel with the species from the top of the chart to the bottom. Moving the strip.placement outside makes sure that the conditions are listed between the species and the chart. Making strip.background empty with a white border allows the group panel with the species to blend in with the white background of the chart. Lastly, changing the panel.spacing to -.01 removes the small gap between each panel so that the chart appears to be one cohesive unit.\n\nThe code for all the charts in this article is available here.

    "section": "A Brief History",
    "text": "A Brief History\n\n\nI was born and raised in Massachusetts about twenty minutes west of Boston. In elementary school, I spent my summers at circus camp where I learned to ride a unicycle, walk on stilts, a variety of other skills generally requiring a large soft pad at the bottom, and failing to figure out how to juggle. In fourth grade, I got so frustrated that I did a project on juggling so that I knew exactly what to do, but I’ve still never been able to get my hands to move the right way. During the fall and winter months, I did ballet and danced in a production of The Nutcracker. It was during our downtime then that I first learned to solve a Rubik’s cube. In middle school, I took part in an archery club after school and eventually began to mentor younger students and carried that on through high school. My junior year of high school, I help start the VEX robotics team and went to World Championships. I also became involved in TV production and joined the local channel.\n\n\n\n  A backstage photo from The Nutcracker (2009)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter graduating high school in 2015, I launched the archery program at a summer camp in Canada and designed and built a modular Gaga pit. (Gaga is sort of like a dodgeball battle-royale that you may recognize from an episode of Bob’s Burgers). I spent the next few years working at a Starbucks where I won my store’s Barista Championship in 2018 and 2019. During my time with the company, I quickly learned all the recipes and became one of the fastest and most reliable baristas in the store. Because of my knowledge and reliablity, I was asked to become a Barista Trainer and helped train baristas, supervisors, and store managers from across the district.\n\n\n\n  Working at Starbucks (2017)\n\n\n\n I attended Florida Poly from Fall 2018 and graduated in May 2022. You can learn more about my time at Florida Poly and projects here. You can learn more about what I’ve been up to since graduating by taking a peek at my LinkedIn, looking at my résumé, or just asking me."

I participate in several book clubs ranging across a variety of data science related topics.

While my passion for biking certainly hasn’t waned, I don’t have as much time as I did when my biggest worries were making it home before dark. Until I moved to Florida, I volunteered for many years with the Pan-Mass Challenge, first as a tire pumper and then a mechanic as I developed my skills. More recently, I started a small mountain biking YouTube channel that I update when I can. I also participated in the 2021 Horrible Hundred and it was exactly as horrible as you might imagine.\n\n\nSpeedsolving\nWhen someone sees you with a Rubik’s cube and asks if you can solve it, they almost never expect to be told, “Give me 15 seconds” and then presented with a solved cube. I have a relatively small collection of puzzles and enjoy the zen mindset that can be found from practicing. I’m rather pleased with my competition results and have some of my solves on camera on a YouTube channel. I’m hoping to get out to competitions a bit more so I can update everyone with all the progress I’ve made. Within the community, I served on the WCA Communications Committee for a brief period, have helped staff a variety of competitions, and even organized my own competition in my hometown called Framingham Frozen Fingers."
