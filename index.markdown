I'm Gus, a Business Analyst with a few years' experience. I'd like to show you what I do.

## Data Focused Projects

### [Disney World ride wait times](/presentations/disney_world_ride_wait_times/)

- **What:** Can I find the best time to visit Disney World üè∞ based on ride wait times?
- **Why:** Going to Disney can be lots of fun, but waiting in lines is not.
- <a href="https://github.com/guslipkin/disney_ds"><b>How:</b></a> `R: {forcats, lubridate, reshape2, tidyverse}`
- **Conclusion:** Try going to Epcot on a Wednesday in September.

### [Investigating a relationship between climate variables and the spread of COVID-19](/presentations/covid_time_series_gis/)

- **What:** Since COVID-19 ü¶† is spread through close contact, do any climate variables influence spread?

- **Conclusion:** Some counties can be modelled very well such as Cook County, Illinois while others, such as Tift County, Georgia, not so much.

## Economic Analysis Focused Projects
