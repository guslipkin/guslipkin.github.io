I'm Gus, a Business Analyst with a few years' experience. I'd like to show you what I do.

### Data Focused Projects

<h4><a href="https://github.com/guslipkin/COVID-TimeSeries-GIS/blob/main/Presentation.pdf">Investigating a relationship between climate variables and the spread of COVID-19</a></h4>

- **What:** Since COVID-19 ü¶† is spread through close contact, do any climate variables influence spread?
- **Why:** Human behavior is affected by the weather. If there is adverse weather, is there an increase in spread?
- <a href="https://github.com/guslipkin/COVID-TimeSeries-GIS"><b>How:</b></a> `ArcGIS`, `ArcMap`, `Excel`, and `R: {data.table, tidyverse}`
- **Conclusion:** Some counties can be modelled very well such as Cook County, Illinois while others, such as Tift County, Georgia, not so much.

<h4><a href="https://github.com/guslipkin/disney_ds/blob/master/presentation/Data%20Science%20Final%20Presentation.pdf">Disney World ride wait times</a></h4>

- **What:** Can I find the best time to visit Disney World üè∞ based on ride wait times?
- **Why:** Going to Disney can be lots of fun, but waiting in lines is not.
- <a href="https://github.com/guslipkin/disney_ds"><b>How:</b></a> `R: {forcats, lubridate, reshape2, tidyverse}`
- **Conclusion:** Try going to Epcot on a Wednesday in September.

### Economic Analysis Focused Projects
