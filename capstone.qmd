		"&emsp;It's a beautiful Wednesday in November and the Seminoles have just beaten the Gators at the Sunshine Showdown only four days prior. You've already had a great week, but a freak snowstorm has lightly dusted Tallahassee and there is just enough snow for sledding. Feeling a zest for life you haven't in a long time due to a rather debilitating stroke a few years earlier, you take some friends and your makeshift sled (a trashcan lid) to Coombs Drive which has a rather large elevation change from top to bottom of about 50 feet. After a full day of sledding, you decide to take one more run to the bottom. Just when you begin to slow down, a car pulls out in front of you from Brown Street and sends you flying into the trees on the far side of the intersection.<br>&emsp;The rest of the day and, admittedly, much of the next is a bit of a blur. Your friends tell you that when you crashed, they were about to call 911, but realized that you had been sledding right behind Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. They scooped you up and brought you to the Emergency Room in just a few minutes, running through some backyards to do so.<br>&emsp;When you come to, a very helpful nurse tells you that it's now Thursday and you've been transferred to the Clinical Decision Unit before handing you a cocktail of pills and a cup of water. You recognize some ibuprofen in there, but that's about it. When you ask him what's in the cup, he says a bunch of words you don't recognize, glances at his watch, then leaves in a hurry. A short while later, you realize you have to pee and wonder how long it's been since you used the bathroom. A different nurse comes after you press the call button and quickly runs to get a jug when you say you have to pee. What follows is a very uncomfortable five minutes where you try and pee in the jug while lying down with a nurse checking on you 30 every seconds asking if you need help.<br>&emsp;After a few more rather uneventful hours, someone comes in to let you know that they'll be discharging you any minute now and you should call someone to come get you. They give you a prescription for some painkillers and tell you to take it easy for a while because you have a concussion. They also advise you to make a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician.",

		"&emsp;I’ve always loved weddings and this one was no exception. A close, and perpetually single, family friend was finally getting married. Feeling fit as a fiddle, I was getting my boogie on on the dance floor until I started to feel some chest pain and discomfort. Feeling weak, lightheaded, and short of breath after the dance, I brushed it off as exhaustion from the excitement of the day and decided to rest for a bit in the rooms outside the venue where we spent the morning getting ready for the big day. However, my pain worsened, so I called for help. The next thing I know, I am in an ambulance on my way to the ER for a heart attack. When we arrived, I was rushed into the ER.<br>&emsp;I can vaguely remember my close family and friends from the wedding trailing behind me. Luckily, the hospital staff acted quickly to save my life. They told me that they were giving me a clot-dissolving drug of some sort and pumped it into my veins. The doctors informed me and my family of the risks of performing an angioplasty and recommended that I was prepared for surgery immediately after my heart attack. I don’t remember much after that, besides the recovery. The days following my surgery were painful, I could hardly even move. Needing help with everything from sitting up to even using the restroom was so unlike me since I’m usually very healthy and otherwise independent. Luckily, the nurses and hospital staff did everything they could to make my recovery go as smoothly as possible. When I was finally ready to go home, my doctor met with me one last time to go over my new medications in detail. I would have never imagined that anything could ever make me less excited about weddings, but here I am."
