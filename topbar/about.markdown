## A Brief History

<div class="grid-container grid-container-right">
  <div class="item-1 item-1-right">
    I was born and raised in Massachusetts about twenty minutes west of Boston. In elementary school, I spent my summers at circus camp where I learned to ride a unicycle, walk on stilts, a variety of other skills generally requiring a large soft pad at the bottom, and failing to figure out how to juggle. In fourth grade, I got so frustrated that I did a project on juggling so that I knew exactly what to do, but I've still never been able to get my hands to move the right way. During the fall and winter months, I did ballet and danced in a production of The Nutcracker. It was during our downtime then that I first learned to solve a Rubik's cube. In middle school, I took part in an archery club after school and eventually began to mentor younger students and carried that on through high school. My junior year of high school, I help start the VEX robotics team and <a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/framingham/flyers-competing-in-world-championships-in-california">went to World Championships</a>. I also became involved in TV production and <a href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/bulletin-tab/2015/06/07/access-framingham-celebrates-new-home/34390600007/">joined the local channel</a>.

    After graduating high school in 2015, I launched the archery program at a summer camp in Canada and <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/precollege/pdfs/gaga-pit.pdf">designed and built</a> a modular <a href="https://www.gagacenter.com/nyc/about/what-is-gaga/">Gaga</a> pit. (Gaga is sort of like a dodgeball battle-royale that you may recognize from <a href="https://bobs-burgers.fandom.com/wiki/Y_Tu_Ga-Ga_Tambien">an episode of Bob's Burgers</a>). I spent the next few years working at a Starbucks where I won my store's Barista Championship in 2018 and 2019. During my time with the company, I quickly learned all the recipes and became one of the fastest and most reliable baristas in the store. Because of my knowledge and reliablity, I was asked to become a Barista Trainer and helped train baristas, supervisors, and store managers from across the district.

I came to Florida Poly during Fall 2018 and the rest, as they say, is history. You can learn more about <a href="https://floridapoly.edu/search/?q=gus+lipkin">my time at Florida Poly</a> and [projects here](/) and see my [resume here](/resume/).

## Selected Interests

### Biking üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Many years ago, there was a summer that I was on my bike so much that I didn't even take my helmet off for meals. While my passion for biking certainly hasn't waned, I don't have as much time as I did when my biggest worries were making it home before dark. Until I moved to Florida, I volunteered for many years with the <a href="https://www.pmc.org">Pan-Mass Challenge</a>, first as a tire pumper and then a mechanic as I developed my skills. More recently, I started a small mountain biking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIYX617QqHZgZ2DmxmbS4A">YouTube channel</a> that I update when I can. I also participated in the 2021 <a href="https://www.horrible-hundred.com">Horrible Hundred</a> and it was exactly as horrible as you might imagine.

### Speedsolving

When someone sees you with a Rubik's cube and asks if you can solve it, they almost never expect to be told, "Give me 15 seconds" and then presented with a solved cube. I have a relatively small collection of puzzles and enjoy the zen mindset that can be found from practicing. I'm rather pleased with my <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2013LIPK01">competition results</a> and have some of my solves on camera on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLH9e8AUL8Pw2T0H2hoPj9Q">YouTube channel</a>. I'm hoping to get out to competitions a bit more so I can update everyone with all the progress I've made. Within the community, I served on the WCA Communications Committee for a brief period, have helped staff a variety of competitions, and even organized my own competition in my hometown called <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/FraminghamFrozenFingers2018">Framingham Frozen Fingers</a>.
