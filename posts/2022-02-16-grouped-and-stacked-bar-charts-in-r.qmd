# Intro 

Sometimes you have a chart that looks like one of these. You have a grouped chart that shows one thing and a stacked chart that shows another. But you really want to show the continent of origin and the condition in one chart.

Maybe the chart you want looks a lot like this:

# Creating the Data

First we load `ggplot2` so we can make our charts. Then we make some data and preview it. `set.seed(2022)` makes sure that our data is the same every time.

```{r}
#| output: FALSE
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(2022)
specie <- c(rep("sorgho", 6), rep("poacee", 6), 
            rep("banana", 6), rep("triticum", 6))
condition <- rep(c("normal" , "stress" , "N2") , 8)
continent <- rep(c("Europe", "Africa", "Asia", "South America",          
                   "North America", "Australia"), 4)
value <- abs(rnorm(24 , 0 , 15))
data <- data.frame(specie, condition, continent, value)
head(data)
```

# Not Quite Right

Our first instinct might be to throw both charts together using `grid.arrange` from the `gridextra` package. While this does show the information we want, it’s not pretty and doesn’t show the data the way we want it to.

```{r}
#| fig-caption: "Two plots graphed together with `gridExtra::grid.arrange()`"
#| alt-text: "A grouped chart and a stacked chart on top of each other"
one <- ggplot(data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = specie, y = value, fill = condition), 
           position = "dodge", stat = "identity")
two <- ggplot(data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = specie, y = value, fill = continent), 
           position = "stack", stat = "identity")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(one, two, nrow = 2)
```

Not sure what to do, we come up with lots of plots that are almost right, but not quite.

Three attempts at making a grouped and stacked bar chart
:::


The last one looks like it could be promising. How did we do it?

```{r}
#| output: FALSE
ggplot(data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = condition, y = value, fill = continent),
           position = "stack",
           stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ specie)
```

We use `ggplot` to set up the pipeline, `geom_bar` to create the bar chart, and then `facet_wrap` is what gives us the four separate charts in one, with one mini-chart for each species. If we can move the charts to be side-by-side, we’ll be a lot closer to the desired outcome. We can use `facet_grid` instead of `facet_wrap` to accomplish that.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Using facet_grid() to show multiple plots next to each other"
#| alt-text: "Four stacked bar charts side-by-side"
ggplot(data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = condition, y = value, fill = continent),
           position = "stack",
           stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(~ specie)
```

This looks much better, but we want it to look like one cohesive plot, rather than four smaller plots.

# The Final Product

I'm going to show you the code that does it, then walk through it so everything makes sense.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "The graph that we came here for"
#| alt-text: "A grouped and stacked bar chart"
ggplot(data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = condition, y = value, fill = continent),
           position = "stack",
           stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(~ specie, switch = "x") +
  theme(strip.placement = "outside",
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = "white"),
        panel.spacing = unit(-.01,"cm"))
```


This looks pretty good and is exactly what we wanted. Like the charts before, we get 90% of the way there with `ggplot`, `geom_bar`, and `facet_grid`. The additions here are the `switch = "x"` argument in `facet_grid`, which moves the group panel with the species from the top of the chart to the bottom. Moving the `strip.placement` outside makes sure that the conditions are listed between the species and the chart. Making `strip.background` empty with a white border allows the group panel with the species to blend in with the white background of the chart. Lastly, changing the `panel.spacing` to `-.01` removes the small gap between each panel so that the chart appears to be one cohesive unit.
