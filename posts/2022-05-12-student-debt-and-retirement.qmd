Data comes from the May 18, 2021 Tidy Tuesday dataset "Wealth and income over 
time"

[The dataset can be found here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-18/readme.md)

# Pre-Intro

I graduated with my BS in Business Analytics a few days ago. My mom came to
visit for graduation and stayed for a few days. I wanted to show her some of
what I learned at school through a hands on activity so we found a Tidy Tuesday
dataset and did some exploring. There's no particular rhyme or reason to this,
but I wanted to share my passion for data with her and thought it would be cool
to share with the rest of you as well. While I did provide some guidance, most
of the exploration is what she thought might be interesting and wanted to
explore.

::: {.callout-important}

From here on out, I wrote down my mom's stream of consciousness thoughts on what
we were working on. It's not necessarily verbatim, but gets her thoughts across.

*Italics are my words*

:::

# Intro

*First we load our packages and data.*

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(kableExtra)

debt <- 
  fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/student_debt.csv')
retirement <-
  fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/retirement.csv')
```

*Do you want to preview the data?*

```{r}
head(debt)
head(retirement)
```

*Do you want to see summary statistics?*

Yeah. Can we do that?

```{r}
summary(debt)
summary(retirement)
```

# Looking at debt

Can we see debt by race?

```{r}
debt |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = race, y = loan_debt))
```

It's been 40 years since I saw a box and whisker plot in college... But it's
interesting that Hispanics seem to have lower debt than Blacks and Whites who
seem to be about equal.

What about debt over time?

```{r}
debt |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = loan_debt, color = race))
```

The difference in debt between Blacks and Whites increases dramatically over 
time.

Does the share of families with debt change over time?

```{r}
debt |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = loan_debt_pct, y = loan_debt, color = race))
```

It appears that fewer Hispanics take on student loan debt than Blacks or Whites.

# Looking at retirement

Can we copy/paste that code for retirement?

*Yes. Yes we can!*

```{r}
retirement |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = race, y = retirement))
```

Whites seem to have much more solid retirement savings that Blacks or Hispanics.
Even the lowest whisker in the Whites plot seems higher than the highest points
in the Black or Hispanics plots.

```{r}
minMaxRetirement <- retirement |>
  group_by(race) |>
  summarise(min = min(retirement), max = max(retirement))
minMaxRetirement

max(minMaxRetirement$min) - min(minMaxRetirement$max)
```

This is terrible! The highest average Hispanic retirement is over $4000 less
than the lowest average White retirement.

```{r}
retirement |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = retirement, color = race))
```

This is not surprising. White retirement savings has increased faster than Black
or Hispanic which has been relatively static.

# Bringing it together

```{r}
debt_retirement <- inner_join(debt, retirement, by = c("year", "race"))
head(debt_retirement)
```

```{r}
debt_retirement |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = loan_debt, y = retirement, color = race))
```

Loan debt doesn't appear to have an effect on retirement for Blacks and
Hispanics. It does have a large effect for Whites.

```{r}
linear <- lm(retirement ~ loan_debt, data = debt_retirement[race == "White",])
summary(linear)
```

Loan debt doesn't have the effect we thought for Whites, and seems to have
minimal effect for Blacks and Hispanics.

```{r}
linear <- lm(retirement ~ ., data = debt_retirement)
summary(linear)
```

I wonder if people with loan debt haven't finished school?

Student loan debt could also be affected by family size which we don't have data
for.

# What if we account for wealth too?

```{r}
wealth <- 
  fread('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/race_wealth.csv') |>
  rename(wealth_type = type)
head(wealth)
```

```{r}
summary(wealth)
```

```{r}
wealth |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = race, y = wealth_family))
```

Oh. That's interesting. I think family wealth includes all assets and debts,
liquid or not. That's not a great indication of actual wealth.

It looks like there's some data missing so lets filter for years greater than or
equal to 1985 and for the median, rather than average, income.

```{r}
wealth |>
  filter(year >= 1985, wealth_type == "Median") |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = wealth_family, color = race))
```

It looks like there isn't any data for Non-Whites. The median has increased for
Whites, but dropped in 2008, while for others it has remained the same over
time.

# Add wealth into the mix

```{r}
df <- left_join(debt_retirement, wealth, by = c("race", "year"))
head(df)
```

*It's kinda confusing with `wealth_type`, let's change it a bit*

```{r}
df <- df |>
  dcast(year + race + loan_debt + loan_debt_pct + retirement ~ wealth_type, 
        value.var = "wealth_family") |>
  rename(average_wealth = Average, median_wealth = Median)
head(df)
```

"Can we scatter this one?" 

*Yes. Yes we can.*

```{r}
df |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = loan_debt, y = average_wealth, color = race))
```

Hispanics only seem to be doing better with having less loan debt.

Can we predict if increasing loan debt is correlated to average wealth?

```{r}
summary(lm(average_wealth ~ loan_debt + race, data = df))
```

This makes sense and tracks with what we saw in the other regressions.

# Bringing it back to retirement

```{r}
summary(lm(retirement ~ ., data = df))
```

I guess this makes sense. If you have money, you have money for retirement.

*Let me show you that R package I made that I always talk about.*

```{r}
dewey::regsearch(df, dependent = "retirement", 
                 independent = colnames(df)[c(1:4, 6:7)], maxvar = 6, 
                 family = "gaussian") |>
  head(12) |>
  kbl() |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", 
                                      "condensed", "responsive"),
                font_size = 14) |>
  scroll_box(height = "250px")
```

*Try choosing a model and defend your choice*

I would choose `retirement ~ + average_wealth + loan_debt + loan_debt_pct +
median_wealth` because it has the highest $R^2$ value.

*That's not quite right. `retirement ~ + average_wealth + median_wealth` is much
better because 96% of the model is explained by those two variables so adding
`loan_debt_pct` and `loan_debt` does not give a lot of benefit.*

*What if we considered interaction terms?*

```{r}
dewey::regsearch(df, dependent = "retirement", 
                 independent = colnames(df)[c(1:4, 6:7)], maxvar = 6, 
                 family = "gaussian", interactions = TRUE) |>
  head(12) |>
  kbl() |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", 
                                      "condensed", "responsive"),
                font_size = 14) |>
  scroll_box(height = "250px")
```

This is pretty cool. Average wealth by itself is pretty good, but when it
interacts with `loan_debt_pct`, `median_wealth`, `race`, and `year`, it seems to
produce a really great model. 

*Of course, we still want to be careful about overfitting.*

# Parting Thoughts

Race appears to have a huge impact on everything and increasing educational debt
increases retirement, but only for Whites. I'd be curious to see the data behind
the loans to learn why increasing educational debt does not always correlate
with increased wealth.

# Post-Conclusion

It's Gus again. I had a really fun time with this. I like to think my mom
learned a lot and I'm hoping you did too.
