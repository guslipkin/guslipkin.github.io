# Intro

Pivoting data can be a little scary sometimes, even if you know exactly what you want to do. But it doesn't need to be. I'm hoping that by the end of this post, you'll feel like the pivot pro you always knew you could be.

## Getting Started

As usual, the first thing we want to do is load our libraries. We'll be using `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` from `tidyverse` as well as the pipe operator, `|>` from `magrittr` which is loaded through `tidyverse`. We're also using `dcast` and `melt` from `data.table` as they are twins to `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer`, respectively. While they are not identical, they perform the same functions are operate somewhat similarly.

```{r LoadLibraries}
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
```

Next we want to create our dummy data. I've been working with theme park data a lot recently, so I modeled the dummy data after that. The data description is as follows:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| variable      | type      | description                                                  |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| rideName      | character | The full name of the ride                                    |
| shortName     | character | A shortened version of the name of the ride                  |
| time          | ITime (from `data.table`) | The time the data was recorded (every 5 minutes from 8am to 5pm) |
| attendance    | double    | The theme park attendance during the time recorded           |
| estimatedWait | double    | The estimated wait time in minutes                           |
| actualWait    | double    | The actual wait time in minutes                              |

</div>

```{r CreateDummyData}
set.seed(2022)
rideName <- 
  rep(c("The Amulet from Below", "The Strong Key Mystery",
        "The Punishment of Bane", "The Mage Beyond the Grave",
        "The Fury from Beyond"), 
      108)
shortName <- rep(c("amulet", "key", "punishment", "mage", "fury"), 108)
time <- as.ITime(rep(seq(8*3600, 17*3600-1, by = 60*5), times = 1, each = 5))
attendance <- rep(round(rnorm(108, 5000, 100)), times = 1, each = 5)
estimatedWait <- round(rnorm(length(rideName), 50, 10))
actualWait <- round(rnorm(length(rideName), estimatedWait, 5))

dt <- data.table(
  rideName, shortName, time, attendance, estimatedWait, actualWait
  )
```

Once created, the data looks like this:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| rideName                  | shortName  | time     | attendance | estimatedWait | actualWait |
|---------------------------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|------------|

| The Strong Key Mystery    | key        | 08:00:00 | 5090       | 62            | 64         |
| The Punishment of Bane    | punishment | 08:00:00 | 5090       | 56            | 55         |
| The Mage Beyond the Grave | mage       | 08:00:00 | 5090       | 40            | 33         |
| The Fury from Beyond      | fury       | 08:00:00 | 5090       | 30            | 19         |
| The Amulet from Below     | amulet     | 08:05:00 | 4883       | 45            | 48         |

# What are...

*While I will show both `pivot_wider`/`dcast` and `pivot_longer`/`melt` in this post, I will default to the `pivot_*` term as it generally makes more sense on the surface.*

## `pivot_wider` and `dcast`

`pivot_wider` and `dcast` take data and reshapes it so that there are more columns and fewer rows than the input data. It allows you to specify a column as a unique identifier and use the values in one or more columns as new column names. The last column is the values that you want placed in the proper intersection between the identifier column value and each new column value.

::: {#fig-original-wider layout-ncol=2}

![The original data](../assets/post-assets/2022-03-31-pivoting-data-with-tidyverse-and-datatable-in-r/original.png){#fig-original}

![The wider data](../assets/post-assets/2022-03-31-pivoting-data-with-tidyverse-and-datatable-in-r/wider.png){#fig-wider}

Wider data expands columns and decreases length

:::

In the example above, I've pivoted the `actualWait` using the `time` and `shortName` columns. We can see that the first five rows of values in `actualWait` have become the first row of values in the wider data. The last row with *The Amulet from Below* at 8:05 becomes the value for `amulet` in the second row of the wider data where the `time` is 8:05.

While `pivot_wider` and `dcast` perform the same function, they behave a little bit differently. `pivot_wider` uses three main arguments `id_cols`, `names_from`, and `values_from`. `dcast`, on the other hand, uses a formula argument in place of both `id_cols` and `names_from` and `value.vars` in place of `values_from`. The second big difference is that column names in `pivot_wider` don't have to be in quotes. They can be, but they don't have to be. On the other hand, only the formula in `dcast` can go without quotes, and in that case they **must not have** quotes while `value.var` **must have** quotes.

## `pivot_longer` and `melt`

`pivot_longer` and `melt` take data and reshape it so that there are more rows and fewer columns than the input data. It allows you to specify specify columns that you want aggregated and the new column names for what was the column names and the values column.

::: {#fig-original-longer layout-ncol=2}

![The original data](../assets/post-assets/2022-03-31-pivoting-data-with-tidyverse-and-datatable-in-r/original.png){#fig-original}

![The longer data](../assets/post-assets/2022-03-31-pivoting-data-with-tidyverse-and-datatable-in-r/longer.png){#fig-longer}

Longer data combines columns and decreases width

:::

In the example above, the `estimatedWait` and `actualWait` columns are consolidated into the `waitType` column where each row specifies if the corresponding `waitTime` column is an estimated or actual wait time.

Like the previous two, `pivot_longer` and `melt` have some differences, although these are smaller. `pivot_longer` uses three primary arguments, `cols`, `names_to`, and `values_to` which correspond to `measure.vars`, `variable.name`, and `value.name`, respectively, from `melt`. Again, the `data.table` version, `melt` requires quotes around each argument value while `pivot_longer` only requires quotes around `names_to` and `values_to` because `cols` is acting as a `select` statement.

# Checking for Duplicates

One of the most important things to keep in mind before using `pivot_wider` or `dcast` is knowing if you should have duplicate data or not. If you shouldn't have any duplicates, you'll want to double check to make sure. To show you how to do this, I've added the first five rows of `dt` to the end of `dt`. If you were to try and pivot the resulting `data.table`, you each value cell would become a list rather than a single value and would look something like this:

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

| time     | amulet    | key       | punishment | mage      | fury      |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 08:00:00 | <dbl [2]> | <dbl [2]> | <dbl [2]>  | <dbl [2]> | <dbl [2]> |
| 08:05:00 | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]>  | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> |
| 08:10:00 | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]>  | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> |
| 08:15:00 | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]>  | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> |
| 08:20:00 | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]>  | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> |
| 08:25:00 | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]>  | <dbl [1]> | <dbl [1]> |

</div>

That's okay if you're expecting multiple values, you'll just need to remember use use `values_fn` for `pivot_wider` or `fun.aggregate` for `dcast` to make sure they are being handled appropriately. A common use-case would be something similar to pivot tables in Excel where you want to count each item. In that case, your function argument would be `count`.

The basic format to check for for duplicates is `x[duplicated(x)]`. However, `duplicated()` only returns `TRUE` for the second or more occurrence of an item in `x`. In order to check for all duplicates, we need to also check `fromLast` like this: `x[duplicated(x) | duplicated(x), fromLast = TRUE]`. Once you have identified your duplicate rows, it is up to you what to do. In some cases, you might be okay using `unique(x)` to get only unique items, or you might want to discard all duplicated items altogether with `x[!duplicated(x) & !duplicated(x, fromLast = TRUE)]`.

```{r DuplicatedData}
# create duplicated data
dtDuplicated <- rbind(dt, dt[1:5])
# DuplicatedData.csv
dtDuplicated |> 
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = !c(rideName, attendance, estimatedWait), 
    names_from = shortName, 
    values_from = actualWait
  )

# DuplicatedOnly.csv
# show all duplicated rows
dtDuplicated |>
  filter(!duplicated(dtDuplicated) & !duplicated(dtDuplicated, fromLast = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(rideName, time)

# DuplicatedDropped.csv
# drop duplicated rows
dtDuplicated |>
  unique()
```

# Pivot Wider

## Wider with One Value Column

In this example, we want to know how long the `actualWait` is for each ride throughout the day with each recording time as a row, and each ride as a column.

In the `pivot_wider`, we want our new column `names_from` to be the `shortName` and our `values_from` `actualWait`. The tricky bit here is the `id_cols` argument. `id_cols` are columns whose values should uniquely identify each row in the data. We need to use it because the `rideName` and `shortName` columns are perfectly correlated, that is, for each row the value of both columns will always be the same. Any column that is not in the `names_from` or `values_from` argument will be part of the default `id_cols` argument. We can use the argument two ways; we can use a numeric vector to select the columns that we want to be used as identifiers, or we can specify columns that we do not want used as a character or column name vector. In the example below, I've included both methods. For the rest of the post, I'll be using the second method.

As mentioned previously, the biggest difference for `dcast` is that it uses a formula instead of the `id_cols` and `names_from` arguments. The left hand side of the formula is the columns that you want to stay as columns to be used as the unique identifier for each row. The right hand side of the formula is the column whose values will be used as the new column names. Lastly, `value.var` defines the column with the desired values.

</div>

## Wider with Two or More Value Columns

Wider data with more than one value column is very similar to one value column. The only changes you need to make in `pivot_wider` are changing your `id_cols` argument if using the column name method and adding the new column to the `values_from` argument. The only change needed in `dcast` is adding to the `value.var` argument. One important thing to note is that the column names will now be a combination of the `names_from`/right hand side argument and the `values_from`/`value.var` argument. The column name order in the `value*` argument determines the column order in the resulting data.

## Pivot Wider Two or More ID Columns

Again, this is pretty similar to a "normal" wider operation. With `pivot_wider` you expand your `id_cols` to include the new columns, or, in my case, drop the `attendance` column so that it is now included. With `dcast`, you simply add the new column to the left hand side of the formula.

# Pivot Longer

`pivot_longer` and `melt` are very similar. The largest differences are the argument names and where they require argument values to be in quotes. `cols`/`measure.vars` are the columns that you want to be aggregated into a single new column. This argument must be in quotes for `melt`, but does not have to be for `pivot_longer` and should be the names of existing columns. `names_to`/`values_to` is the name of the column that will say which column was used for that row and `values_to`/`value.name` are the corresponding values. The name for each of these new columns is up to you. I have decided on `waitType` to describe if it is an `estimatedWait` or `actualWait` and `waitTime` to hold the value.

I've saved a copy of the longer data as `dtLonger` so that we can explore `pivot_wider` and `dcast` a bit more.

# Pivot Wider (from Longer)

## Pivot Wider with Two or More Name Columns

We want to take our new longer data and change it to wider data where we want to know how long the `actualWait` and `estimatedWait` are for each ride throughout the day with each recording time as a row, and each ride as a column and `waitType` and `shortName`.

For `pivot_wider`, we want our column names to use both the `waitType` and `shortName` and our values from `waitTime`. `id_cols` is then the remaining columns that we don't want. With `dcast`, we want to add `waitType` and `shortName` to the right hand side of the formula so they are used as the column names, and `time` to the left hand side for the row identifiers. For both, `values_from` and `value.var` are our `waitTime` column.

Like when using multiple values in `value_from`/`value.var`, the new column names are all combinations of values in `names_from` or right hand side. The combinations will be given in the order the column names are specified.

## Pivot Wider with Mutiple ID and Name Columns

If you've been following along so far, the code below should make sense. We want to use `time` and `attendance` as the row identifiers and the `estimatedWait` and `actualWait` as the values for each ride.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### `tidyverse`

```{r PivotWiderTwoLeftRight}
# pivot wider with more than one left and right hand column
dtLonger |> 
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = !rideName, 
    names_from = c(waitType, shortName), 
    values_from = waitTime
  )
```

### `data.table`

```{r}
# pivot wider with more than one left and right hand column
dtLonger |> 
  dcast(time + attendance ~ waitType + shortName, value.var = "waitTime")
```

# Pivot Longer (from Wider)

```{r}
#| include: false
dtWider <-
  dtLonger |> 
  dcast(time + attendance ~ waitType + shortName, value.var = "waitTime")
```

Let's say that instead of our original table, we get our data formatted like our output from Pivot Wider. We have a time and attendance for each row, and a pair of `estimatedWait_*` and `actualWait_*` columns for each ride. How can we convert this back to a format where we have rows for each ride, time, and attendance, and columns for the `estimatedWait` and `actualWait`? Let's call that data.table `dtWider`.

There are a few key changes here, compared to the previous section on `pivot_longer`. Since we now have 10 columns that we want to pivot (2 types of waits for each of the five rides), it would be annoying to name every column and so we can turn to `tidyselect` for help. We can use `contains` to select every column that contains "Wait" in it. The next key difference is the `names_pattern` argument that takes the place of `values_to`. We supply a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) where each capture group (the bits between parentheses) represents how we want the column names split. We want either "estimatedwait" or "actualWait" and any character that comes after the "_" because those are the ride short names. We then supply two values in a vector to `names_to`. The new `".value"` item represents the `values_to` argument and its placement in the vector is important as it must match the capture group from `names_pattern` that you want to use as the value columns. In this case, we want our wait columns to be our value columns and since that is the first capture group, we place `".value"` first. Our second name, `"shortName"` is then matched to the second capture group which is the ride names. Lastly, just to get everything in the same order as our original data, we arrange by `time`.

Unfortunately, the solution for `melt` isn't as clean. Instead of supplying `measure.vars` with column names with `contains`, we need to supply a function call to `patterns`. Similar to the `names_pattern` argument, we need to supply a regular expression. However, here we need to distinguish our different wait types so we supply one pattern each for each of the two wait types. We can then supply a vector to `value.name` with our two wait column names. Like with `pivot_longer`, we need to make sure that our `patterns` arguments are in the same order as the vector supplied to `value.name`. Lastly, we can supply our `variable.name`. Unfortunately, `melt` can't grab our ride names from our regular expressions like `pivot_longer` can and so our `shortName` column is now a factor with numbers. Thankfully, this is a relatively easy fix with `forcats::lvls_revalue` that helps us re-assign our factors to their original names. Then, just like with `pivot_longer`, we arrange by `time` to get back to our original format.

    cols = contains("Wait"),
    names_pattern = "(estimatedWait|actualWait)_(.+)",

`data.table` methods are faster than `tidyverse` and wider to longer is faster than longer to wider.

## Conclusion

I'm hoping that by now you're more comfortable with `pivot_wider`/`dcast` and `pivot_longer`/`melt` than you were before. Generally, before you begin reshaping data, you want to know what your resulting data should look like and if you'll have any duplicate rows. From there, decide if you want to use `tidyverse` or `data.table` and then write your code.
